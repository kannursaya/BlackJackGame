# BlackJackGame
This is a simple Blackjack game built using Python. The game follows the classic rules of 21, where players compete against the dealer to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

ðŸŽ® Features:

Single-player mode against a computer dealer ðŸ¤–

Randomized card draws using a standard deck 

Game logic for hitting, standing, and busting

Automatic dealer behavior following Blackjack rules

ðŸš€ How to Play:

The player and dealer are dealt two cards each.

The player can hit (draw a new card) or stand (keep their current hand).

The dealer follows standard Blackjack rules (must hit on 16, stand on 17+).

The winner is determined based on who gets closest to 21 without busting.
